    <h1>Future of Nuclear Energy</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <h2>1990-2011</h2>
    <button class="collapsible">Recap</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>So as we discussed in the history page Nuclear energy up until 1990 grew consistently even with many setbacks. But after the chernobyl disaster the explosive growth phase was over with the U.S.S.R coming to an end the cold war was officially over and with that there was no need for America to constantly force innovation in the sector, so they largely slowed down new manafacturing and instead focused on a largely left out aspect of nuclear energy, safety regualtion. This aspecst had been largely looked over due to the fear of missing out aginst the soviets. This was the case for many western countries. So some countries like germay started to decrease their nuclear ambitions and others like france decided that they needed to maintain their existing infrastructure. So if we just see what i have been telling than we will see that there is no addition instead only decrease, but when we look at the below graph nuclear energy still keeps growing albeit at a much slower rate.<br><img src="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth104/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.earth104/files/Unit2/Mod8/Earth104Mod8Fig2.png" alt="graph"><br> Well than how did this happen? while the west was largely pulling out of nuclear energy and into renewables like hydro or fossil fuels, The east picked off from where the west left and continued growing. Japan is a prime example of this. Japan grew its nuclear power plants and by 2008 25% of its energy needs were fulfilled by nuclear sources.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <button class="collapsible">Reasons the East chose nuclear energy</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Independance</b> is one of the main pull factors for nuclear energy as a country like japan is an island nation and being an island nation it doesnt have that many natural resources and with its development in 2 decades it didnt have the time to think of the energy issue and when the world got hit with the first oil crisis. it alongside many other nations realized their mistake of thinking that every thing will always stay the same and that the trade of fossil fuels will stay stable. So they thought of solutions renewables werent an option as they were highly location dependant and japan being an island nation didnt have that. the other option was fossil fuels. they couldnt import it as that was a short term solution and they didnt have their own reserves due to the location. So they needed a solution that was Independant, Cheap in the long run , not location dependant. These conditions are met by 2 sources: Nuclear and solar but we can rule solar energy out as at the time it was in its baby phase with it not being a viable option Japan chose nuclear energy. and it went quiet well until 2010. </p>

    <button class="collapsible">Fukasima disaster</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>In 2011, An earthquake occured in japan and this was one of the strongest earthquakes in the millenium with a magnitude of 9 usually 6 is considered high as that is enough to do damage and 7 is enough to destroy buildings and homes. So this 9 magnitude disaster was unexpected to say the least. But as the aftermath of the earthquake, a tsunami was formed due to the violent shaking. This tsunami was big enough to bypass the water and flood blocking systems. As we all know that water and electricity dont mix and as soon as water came in, it broke crucial systems required to cool down the plants and due to overheating the plants reactors went meltdown mode, releasing a ton of radioactivty into the envirnoment.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <button class="collapsible">It's Direct effects</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>As a direct effect of the disaster one hundred and fifty five thousand people were displaced and to this day most havent gone back due to the health risks and the economic downfall of the area</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Reasons for Decline After 2011</h2>
    <button class="collapsible">Public Sentiment</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I am pretty sure having something being linked with a name synonymous with deaths, terror and war is not the most appealing. For most people, when they hear about nuclear energy they think of bombs or explosions and this is further proven true and at the same time exaggerated by the media as nuclear is mostly pictured as a burnt out place with alot of green particles and everything completely razed.Thee fact that nuclear power plants have exploded massively 2 times and both times the picture in people's minds has been solidified.So people, mostly look at the headlines and not the backstory. So when the fukushima disaster occured people learnt what happened and the damage it caused and blame it on the nuclear plant and dont know the fact that the nuclear plant exploded due to a huge and disastorous earthquake.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <button class="collapsible">Lack of private interest</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>In history there are alot of technologies that even though the public sentiment was negative for but the private sector kept it alive for example unrepairable stuff. The public does not like it bt since the companies have noticed that the consumers dont react hugely to this they see that the earnings they will earn through the repairs or the additional sales will offset the tiny cost that some customers will leave the company's product. So why is nuclear not beneficial for the private sector. One of the reasons that the private sector hasnt caught on is that nuclear energy has high barriers to entry. Ok what is a barrier to entry, In a business a barrier to entry is anything that prevents a person form entering like maybe a person has a great idea but no capital or vice versa the business will not work. And nuclear energy has one of the highest barriers to entry in all energy sources as building a plant can take 6 billion dollars over the course of 6 years and this is 3 times more expensive and a 3 times longer process than a coal power plant. So are nuclear plants more exensive, No! they are expensive in the short term as it takes 20+ years for a nuclear plant to break even while a coal plant breaks even within 10 years but we are forgetting that a nuclear plant is much cheaper to maintain so over time in a period of 25 years it crosses the coal plant in profitability but not many companies who start have 25 years to give the investors their return. so investors will not invest and it will be upto the goverment to take action and innovate and if their is one thing synonemous with the government it is lengthy burocrecy and it takes decades for an outcome</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <button class="collapsible">Government</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This might come as a shock that the very reason for the rapid growth of nuclear energy is a reson for its decline. well it makes alot of sense as the goverment does what the public sentiment wants to do. in the cold war the public sentiment was win at all cost and the goverments did just that or tried to do that but in 2010s the sentiment was denuclearize. even though the goverments know the long term impacts they at the end of the also come in to the pressure due to  the same reason that the private sector is swayed off which is the long R.O.I a election might be failed and the next prime minister might reap the rewards of the seeds that were sown by the previous ruler.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Germany!</h2>
    <button class="collapsible">What did Germany do?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Germany had a dreamly nuclear powered grid with it competing against the top nations with 25 percent of its energy needs being fulfilled by nuclear power plants but ever since chernobyl it has only been downhill. today nuclear energy only accounts for 13 percent of the total needs and it is planned to take that to zero. this was mainly due to activists and the government gave in and sadly its not been a good decision at least until now with germany being heavily dependant on non renewables and due to this when russia declared war on ukraine it got hit hard with price of energy surging pretty high very quickly</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Maybe A More Favorable Future?</h2>
    <button class="collapsible">How are developing nations contributing?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Developing nations are the backbone for nuclear energy since the 2010's as the developing world still needs alot of energy and unlike the rest of the world they have yet not seen the consequences so the sentiment is positive. While developed nations focus on innovation and how to make it better suited to be later more adoptable. The developing world hungry for energy solutions still keeps on making new reactors and keeping the tech alive long enough till there is another eureka in the field. The most ambitious of these nations has been China.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <button class="collapsible">Solving the problems</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
         So, the reasons I gave above are kind of reversing now. Public sentiment is bouncing back up due to the envrnoment problem and the hate towards fossil fuel.and when the sentiment changes so does the government's opinion and there is a slight bounce back in projects with Japan's nuclear energy bouncing from a low of 2% in 2013 to 5% in 2018. Meanwhile in my opinion the biggest change needed is also happening. the roi and costs are slightly coming down due to innovations in plant design as their is big focus on modular reactors and we have seen quiet a bit of innovation with china being the main player here.

    <button class="collapsible">Nuclear Fusion: The light in the darkness</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Nuclear fusion is increasingly seen as the potential savior for nuclear energy, offering a clean, virtually limitless source of power by replicating the processes that fuel the sun. Unlike nuclear fission, which splits atoms and produces long-lived radioactive waste, fusion combines hydrogen isotopes to form helium, generating immense energy with minimal waste and no risk of a catastrophic meltdown. Collaborative efforts such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), involving 35 countries including the United States, China, Russia, India, and the European Union, highlight the global commitment to harnessing fusion\u2019s potential. Fusion's advantages include abundant fuel sources like deuterium and tritium, no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, and enhanced safety compared to fission. Though significant challenges remain, such as sustaining high-temperature plasma and achieving commercial viability, fusion holds immense promise as a critical component of the future energy mix, capable of addressing climate change while meeting the growing global demand for energy.

    <button class="collapsible">The future is still uncertain</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        while we are seeing these shifts these are still minor and not enough to set the trajectory and compared to other tech like solar panels the advancements are quiet insufficient. Now what do you think will the titanic be able to shift or will it hit the iceberg?
