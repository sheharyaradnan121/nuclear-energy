   <h1>So After 2010?</h1>
   <h2>Recap:</h2>
   <p>So as we discussed in the history page Nuclear energy up until 2010 grew consistently even with many setbacks. But after the chernobyl disaster the explosive growth phase was over with the U.S.S.R coming to an end the cold war was officially over and with that there was no need for america to constantly force innovation in the sector so they largely slowed down new manafacturing and instead focused on the largely behind safety regualtion as this aspecst had been largely looked over due to the fear of missing out aginst the soviets. This was seen with many western countries.but if we look at the graph below nuclear energy keeps rising at a much slower pace <br><img src="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth104/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.earth104/files/Unit2/Mod8/Earth104Mod8Fig2.png" alt="graph"><br>You might ask why is it like that well the world is not just the west there are other countries that were propelling this for example japan was still massively interested in the proposition of nuclear energy. the main advantage for japan was that Japan being a Island nation really does not have any beneficial features for its energy production. So it was and still is desperate to this day for fuel sources as it needs to import a ton of fuel from the outside with more than 60 percent of its energy sources being oil and coal which it does not have but in the 1990s there was a spark of light for japan in the form oif nuclear energy with nuclear energy rapidly growing to 30% of the nations total energy source this is really really good for a nation as this makes a nation more independant and manage prices itself but this would all come to an end in 2010s as just 2 years after the fukashima diaster. nuclear had fallen to just under 2 percent of the total needs with many plants being declassified. Keep in mind that these were working plants and as we will discuss later the biggest problem that nuclear energy faces is the huge barrier to entry.So after the fukusima disaster nuclear energy has largey stayed stagnant globally but like money if a 100 dollars remain a 100 dollars yes you did not lose money but the monety lost its value to inflation and the same can be set to nuclear energy as well. although it has stayed stagnant, the overall market grew meaning that its total share has declined.</p>

   <h2>Reasons for decline</h2>
   <p>There are many reasons why nuclear energy has lost its popularity over the years. First, the costs to build a nuclear power plant are ridiculously high. It takes billions of dollars just to start a project, and on top of that, it can take years, even decades, before the plant starts generating enough electricity to make back the money spent. This long return on investment (ROI) period makes nuclear energy a risky business for investors. Another big issue is that people just don’t trust nuclear energy anymore. After events like Fukushima, the idea of nuclear reactors exploding or leaking radiation has scared a lot of people. This has led to protests and stricter government rules, making it even harder to get new plants approved. Plus, with solar and wind energy becoming so cheap and easy to set up, nuclear energy is finding it hard to compete. All these factors combined have slowed down the growth of nuclear energy worldwide.
   </p>

   <h2>Germany!</h2>
   <p> Germany had a dreamly nuclear powered grid with it competing against the top nations with 25 percent of its energy needs being fulfilled by nuclear power plants but ever since chernobyl it has only been downhill. today nuclear energy only accounts for 13 percent of the total needs and it is lanned to take that to zero. this was mainly due to activists and the government gave in and sadly its not been a good decision at least until now with germany being heavily dependant on non renewables and due to this when russia declared war on ukraine it got hit hard with price of energy surging pretty high very quickly</p>

   <h2>Reason for Such a slow decline</h2>
   <p>While nuclear energy faced challenges in the West, developing nations continued to pursue it as a means to secure energy independence and meet climate goals. In the past decade, these nations have achieved significant milestones:

    India: India has expanded its nuclear capacity with the operationalization of new reactors like Kudankulam Units 1 and 2, with an ambitious goal of reaching 20 GW by 2030. It has also strengthened its collaboration with countries like Russia and the U.S. for advanced reactor technology and fuel supply.
    
    Pakistan: Pakistan added new nuclear reactors, including Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Units 3 and 4, with a combined capacity of over 600 MW. In 2021, the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant Unit-2 (K-2), a 1,100 MW reactor, became operational, representing a significant leap in its nuclear energy output.
    
    China: As a global leader in nuclear energy, China has consistently built and commissioned reactors, such as the Hualong One reactors, showcasing indigenous innovation. By 2023, it had over 20 GW of nuclear capacity under construction, aiming to double its capacity by 2035.
    
    South Africa: Despite economic challenges, South Africa successfully extended the operational life of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station, the only nuclear plant in Africa, and laid groundwork for future expansion plans to stabilize its grid and reduce coal dependency.</p>

    <h2>So is it over?</h2>
    <p>The landscape of nuclear energy is shifting toward a more optimistic future:

      Public Sentiment: Growing awareness of climate change has softened opposition to nuclear energy, recognizing its low-carbon footprint.
      
      Economic Innovations: Small modular reactors (SMRs) offer scalable and cost-effective solutions, reducing construction risks and timelines.
      
      Safety Enhancements: Next-generation reactors incorporate passive safety systems and advanced materials to mitigate risks.
      
      Policy and International Collaboration: Efforts to streamline regulatory processes and foster global partnerships are reducing barriers to entry.</p>
    <h2>Nuclear fusion</h2>
    <p>
      Fusion energy—the process of mimicking the sun’s power—is seen as the holy grail of clean energy:

Technological Progress: Projects like ITER and advancements in tokamak reactors demonstrate significant strides toward achieving sustained fusion reactions.

Advantages Over Fission: Fusion produces minimal radioactive waste, has no meltdown risk, and uses abundant fuel sources like hydrogen isotopes.

Challenges: High costs, complex engineering, and scalability remain significant hurdles, but recent breakthroughs suggest commercial viability within decades.
